## Introduction
This project aims to analyze COVID-19 trends through policy making from the first year of the 2020 pandemic. The project was completed on Microsoft Azure through the use of Azure Data Factory, Azure Synpase Analytics, and Power BI. The resource groups for this project were first deployed of time by the professor, and tasks were delegated to all team members. Predictions were then hypothesized. By connecting Azure Synapse and Power BI, a Power BI report was created and findings were presented.
